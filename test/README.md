# test

AI-assisted development project using AI-Core agents.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Complete Workflow (Recommended)
Type in Claude Code:
```bash
namiez-core-flow
```

This will guide you through the complete development workflow from requirements to deployment-ready code.

### Individual Agents
You can also use agents directly:
```bash
requirements          # Start with requirements analysis
coder                 # Implement code
reviewer              # Review code quality
tester                # Test functionality
refactor              # Improve code quality
coordinator           # Project overview
```

## 📋 Available Agents

1. **namiez-core-flow** - Main orchestrator for complete workflow
2. **requirements** - Clarify and document requirements
3. **coder** - Implement solutions following best practices  
4. **reviewer** - Ensure code quality and identify issues
5. **tester** - Comprehensive testing and verification
6. **refactor** - Refactor and optimize code
7. **coordinator** - Project overview and tracking

## 🎯 Workflow Example

### Start Complete Flow
```bash
namiez-core-flow
```

### Choose Your Project Type
```
What would you like to work on today?
1. New Feature
2. Bug Fix
3. Code Review
4. Refactoring

Choose option (1-5):
```

### Follow Guided Process
The flow will guide you through each stage, maintaining context throughout:
1. **Requirements** - Describe what you want to build
2. **Implementation** - AI helps you code it
3. **Review** - Quality check and improvements
4. **Testing** - Verify it works correctly
5. **Refactor** - Polish and optimize

### Navigate the Flow
During the flow, use these commands:
- `continue` or `next` - Move to next agent
- `previous` or `back` - Go back one stage
- `jump to [agent]` - Jump to specific agent
- `show progress` - See current status
- `view outputs` - See all generated documentation
- `end flow` - Complete and generate summary

## 📁 Generated Documentation

All outputs are stored in the `.ai/` directory:

- `.ai/requirements/` - Requirements analysis
- `.ai/implementation/` - Implementation details
- `.ai/review/` - Code review reports  
- `.ai/testing/` - Test results
- `.ai/refactor/` - Refactoring documentation
- `.ai/coordinator/` - Project tracking
- `.ai/flows/` - Flow state and session management

## ⚙️ Configuration

AI-Core is configured via `.ai-config.json` in the project root.

## 🔄 Quick Workflows

### Bug Fix
```bash
namiez-core-flow → (choose Bug Fix) → coder → tester
```

### Code Review Only
```bash
reviewer
```

### Enhancement
```bash
namiez-core-flow → (choose Enhancement) → requirements → coder → tester
```

## 💡 Tips

- **Use namiez-core-flow** for complete projects - it maintains context across all stages
- **Stay in control** - you decide when to move to the next agent
- **Jump around** - go back to previous agents or skip ahead as needed
- **Auto-documentation** - everything is documented automatically

For detailed documentation, see the [AI-Core repository](https://github.com/your-username/namiez-core).
