3. Read review from `.ai/review/{issue-name}.md`
4. Create test plan based on acceptance criteria
5. Set up test environment
6. Execute test cases systematically
7. Document results and findings
8. Verify all requirements are met
9. Report bugs with detailed reproduction steps
10. Provide recommendations for fixes
